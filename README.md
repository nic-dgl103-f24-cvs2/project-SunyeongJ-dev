# Project Website Plan
This website was created for educational purposes.


## 1. Project Summary

The purpose of this website is to introduce and promote a barbecue restaurant in the Comox Valley, targeting anyone interested in enjoying barbecue in the area. The site provides essential information, including menu options, pricing, opening hours, and additional services like smoker rentals and custom orders. By showcasing these offerings, the website encourages visitors to book events and subscribe to email updates about upcoming events.

The current website has several areas for improvement: smoker rental and custom order details are split across separate pages, menu information is misplaced, and the homepage photos and layout lack organization, with no background colors to define sections.

**Website URL**: [https://bigbrisketbarbecue.com](https://bigbrisketbarbecue.com)


## 2. Look and Feel

The website should convey a lively and appetizing mood to tempt visitors to try the barbecue offerings. For design inspiration, 
I found two barbecue websites that align well with this concept: [Smoke and Bones BBQ](https://smokeandbones.ca) and [Butcher’s Block BBQ](http://www.butchersblockbbq.com).
